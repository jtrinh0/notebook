My first love<br/>
Was the sky.<br/>
<br/>
I crane my neck back<br/>
And stare up.<br/>
<br/>
The clouds clump together<br/>
In creative formations<br/>
Until the puffs of cotton dissolve,<br/>
And a garden grows above.<br/>
<br/>
In my garden<br/>
Are orange sorbet snapdragons<br/>
That roar to life<br/>
Among the thorny spines<br/>
Of burgundy wine roses<br/>
That simply want to protect themselves.<br/>
<br/>
In my garden<br/>
Are white lilacs,<br/>
Petals pure and angelic.<br/>
They peak through<br/>
Honeydew vines,<br/>
Shells concealing the sweet jewels<br/>
In the hearts of the melons.<br/>
<br/>
The clouds morph,<br/>
And a forest grows above.<br/>
<br/>
In my forest<br/>
Are enormous evergreens<br/>
Longing to touch the sky,<br/>
And they force themselves<br/>
To smile and stand tall<br/>
Even when they feel blue.<br/>
<br/>
In my forest<br/>
Are caribou fawns<br/>
Stumbling to take their first steps,<br/>
Daring to explore the world<br/>
Before they've grown antlers.<br/>
<br/>
The clouds again morph,<br/>
And an arctic tundra grows above.<br/>
<br/>
In my arctic tundra<br/>
Are polar bears,<br/>
Paws soaked through,<br/>
Fishing for their cubs,<br/>
Struggling with the inner conflict<br/>
That survival entails another's death.<br/>
<br/>
In my arctic tundra<br/>
Are snow foxes<br/>
That have evolved to adapt,<br/>
Fiery coats turning white<br/>
To camouflage with the ice.<br/>
<br/>
The sun set paints the sky,<br/>
And a coral reef grows above.<br/>
<br/>
In my coral reef<br/>
Are wise mollusks teaching<br/>
The rash young ones<br/>
To have patience<br/>
And take one step at a time.<br/>
<br/>
In my coral reef<br/>
Are clownfish<br/>
That know how to laugh,<br/>
That jest and goof around,<br/>
That understand<br/>
How much brighter life can be<br/>
With a sense of humor.<br/>
<br/>
Night washes over,<br/>
And constellations grow above me.<br/>
<br/>
In my constellations<br/>
Are blessings.<br/>
I count my stars,<br/>
And a wave of gratitude floods me.<br/>
<br/>
I understand why<br/>
The sky was my first love.<br/>
<br/>
Its ever-changing nature<br/>
Reminds me of the beautiful journey<br/>
Called life.
