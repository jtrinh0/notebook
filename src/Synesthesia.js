<br/>
One could argue<br/>
All poets have synesthesia,<br/>
Only with words.<br/>
<br/>
When a tangerine touches my taste buds,<br/>
My tongue does not simply register<br/>
Sweetness, sourness, and juiciness.<br/>
Rather, I partake in the waggle dance of the bees that have pollinated it,<br/>
And I melt into the colors of the sun when it retires.<br/>
<br/>
Patterns merge into one another,<br/>
And if I magnify a leaf enough,<br/>
Its veins become a network of cities I view from a satellite.<br/>
<br/>
If I squint my eyes,<br/>
Bustling cars are a colony of ants,<br/>
Stampeding over their kin<br/>
In attempts to sniff out their way home,<br/>
And city lights are wandering ghosts<br/>
Who have long forgotten the meaning of life.<br/>
<br/>
I can smell electricity<br/>
Like burning paper<br/>
Turning to ashes in a campfire,<br/>
Pleading with the logs from which they came to have mercy.<br/>
<br/>
My sailboat is the mediator<br/>
Between the wind and the sea;<br/>
The two howl and rage<br/>
In constant feud,<br/>
Forcing me to escape.<br/>
<br/>
So I climb to the mountain's peak,<br/>
And the breathtaking moon beckons.<br/>
It is a lonely orb amongst a vast galaxy of stars.<br/>
The streams on my cheeks flood into rivers,<br/>
Because I know.<br/>
<br/>
I know what it is like<br/>
To be in the center<br/>
Of a pack of wolves,<br/>
Herd of gazelles,<br/>
Flock of birds,<br/>
School of fish,<br/>
Yet at the same time--<br/>
Be alone.<br/>
<br/>
I don't just see black.<br/>
I can feel darkness<br/>
Enveloping me,<br/>
Hugging me, comforting me<br/>
With an embrace that whispers,<br/>
"It is okay to cry;<br/>
I will conceal your weakness."<br/>
<br/>
And I desire more than anything in the world<br/>
To swing a lasso around the moon<br/>
And hoist myself to her.<br/>
But Earth is playing tug of war,<br/>
And gravity ties me down.<br/>
<br/>
I thrash the way a fish does on land,<br/>
As it relentlessly pulls me under,<br/>
And I am suffocating, drowning.<br/>
<br/>
But with the drenched dirt around me,<br/>
I start constructing a staircase to the sky,<br/>
And layers form steps.<br/>
<br/>
I mold this for you,<br/>
My fellow poet,<br/>
Because only you<br/>
Would be able to understand<br/>
When I admit:<br/>
I can no longer look at the world<br/>
Without seeing metaphors burst to life.
