<br/>
Monochrome is simpler,<br/>
Yet we enjoy playing with colors,<br/>
Feeling every emotion tenfold<br/>
And burning with delicate intensity.<br/>
<br/>
In the wee hours when everyone else is asleep<br/>
And the universe fades to gray,<br/>
The comfort we find in each other's embrace<br/>
Is more than enough<br/>
To warm our hearts.<br/>
<br/>
We lay side by side,<br/>
limbs intertwined like a vineyard, and it's<br/>
A single moment that stretches into infinity.<br/>
Sunrises entail goodbyes I dread whispering,<br/>
Because although I can write as though I am painting or sewing with words,<br/>
"Goodbye" is one that stales on the bristles;<br/>
Its letters are threads too frail to weave.<br/>
When will the time come when our hands won't have to let go?<br/>
<br/>
The memories we create<br/>
Are stored in my chest, securely tucked away so that<br/>
Even if they erode with the passage of time,<br/>
And I can no longer recall<br/>
The sensation of your soft hair between my fingers,<br/>
The sight of your smiling eyes gentle yet stark with ambition,<br/>
The melody of your carefree laughter<br/>
Permeating the autumn air back to my childhood,<br/>
Or the taste of your tongue dancing with mine,<br/>
Our treasures will still be part of me.<br/>
<br/>
The journey on which we embark<br/>
Is just starting to set sail.<br/>
You were gifted with wings<br/>
To fly to your dreams,<br/>
So don't flutter-- soar with every fiber of your being,<br/>
Because I will be doing exactly that.<br/>
<br/>
Learn, achieve, discover your passions and potential;<br/>
Hunger to experience the things you have left untouched,<br/>
For life is too breathtaking to blindly sprint through.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it means trekking up different mountains<br/>
In different continents at different paces by different methods,<br/>
But once we reach the pinnacle of our independent growth,<br/>
Find me, honey,<br/>
And let me share with you the world I've set ablaze.<br/>
