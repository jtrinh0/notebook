<br/>
Curiosity:<br/>
a bridge of our minds,<br/>
inspiring us to challenge<br/>
universally accepted truths<br/>
about the nature of our surroundings<br/>
<br/>
Rain:<br/>
the pitter-patter resounding in your chest,<br/>
watering the kisses I plant along your neck<br/>
<br/>
Flowers:<br/>
the garden of appreciation<br/>
blossoming from my heart<br/>
that has left a trail of poppy seeds<br/>
leading me to you<br/>
<br/>
Sun:<br/>
the warmth emanating<br/>
from your arms that buckle my waist,<br/>
and the crow's feet dancing with joy<br/>
every time your eyes radiate with a smile<br/>
<br/>
Wildlife:<br/>
the courtship dance that commences<br/>
when your nose pecks at mine,<br/>
and they engage in the art of sword fighting<br/>
<br/>
Volcano:<br/>
the eruption of playful giggles<br/>
that escape when you blow bubbles<br/>
into my belly and ignite a tickle war<br/>
<br/>
Earthquakes:<br/>
the separation of tectonic plates<br/>
when we dive to the floor<br/>
in a tackle of laughter and screams,<br/>
wrestling because we're each too stubborn to admit defeat<br/>
<br/>
Sea:<br/>
the blue depths of your eyes,<br/>
which I drown into while they<br/>
reflect light and dark patterns<br/>
and steal my breath<br/>
<br/>
Constellations:<br/>
the beautiful formations born<br/>
when the stars of your palms<br/>
wrap around the stars of mine,<br/>
and a thousand light years<br/>
crash into one another<br/>
<br/>
Time:<br/>
the skewed reality that hiccups<br/>
when the redwoods engulf us,<br/>
and we gaze at the boundless night, momentarily believing<br/>
we're the only two in this vast world<br/>
<br/>
Magic:<br/>
an enchanting feeling<br/>
that has sprinkled into existence<br/>
ever since the creation of the universe<br/>
of us...
