<br/>
He trudges along a spiny dirt path,<br/>
Wind howling<br/>
Hysterically against the cavities of his ears,<br/>
Rain shattering<br/>
Like shards of glass against his skin.<br/>
<br/>
He plants one calloused foot<br/>
In front of the other,<br/>
leaving behind a trail of crimson.<br/>
<br/>
His heart pulses sporadically<br/>
Like a broken metronome,<br/>
And he feels the echos of its beats<br/>
Reverberating off his fingertips<br/>
Only to be lost in the ominous clouds.<br/> 
<br/>
The storm shoves a wasp into his eye,<br/>
And following the venomous needle<br/>
Is an indeciperable shriek<br/>
As he blindly sprints<br/>
Through the oppressive moutains.<br/>
<br/>
The cold world has turned its back<br/>
And shoveled all burdens into his pack<br/>
Time has run out<br/>
And he no longer recalls<br/>
The warmth of being held.<br/>
<br/>
He collapses,<br/>
Face in crusted mud.<br/>
With the last fiber of his being,<br/>
He whisperes, "I'll find you, Honey.<br/>
You were my world<br/>
All along.<br/>
How could I have set us ablaze?"<br/>
