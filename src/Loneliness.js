<br/>
Feeling lonely next to you<br/>
Hurts infinitely more than<br/>
Feeling lonely by myself.<br/>
<br/>
Something about your eyes<br/>
Makes them look worn beyond their years.<br/>
Maybe it's the accentuated bags beneath them,<br/>
Or maybe it's the luster that has been lost.<br/>
<br/>
But you don't just beam,<br/>
You set fire to the fields.<br/>
You don't just rage,<br/>
You sever our continent in half.<br/>
And you don't just rain,<br/>
You pour,<br/>
Then drown in your own flood.<br/>
<br/>
And it even though it shouldn't,<br/>
It gives me hope<br/>
<br/>
Because any emotion is better<br/>
Than the tired indifference<br/>
Of a body that has been hollowed out.<br/>
<br/>
More often that not,<br/>
You are a ghost,<br/>
And that frightens me.
