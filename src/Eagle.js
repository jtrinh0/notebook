<br/>
My eagle, my companion:<br/>
If the decision was mine,<br/>
I'd keep you for a lifetime,<br/>
But I cannot bring myself<br/>
To hold you captive<br/>
Knowing the sky is your limit.<br/>
<br/>
If you choose to fly away,<br/>
I will set you free.<br/>
Part of me hopes<br/>
You'll return home and<br/>
Tell me how the world appears<br/>
From a bird's eye-view<br/>
<br/>
To share your new observations<br/>
On the centralization and vulnerability<br/>
Of humans-- no, that's a lie.<br/>
Had you no information to give,<br/>
I would still want to feel<br/>
Your warmth in my arms.<br/>
<br/>
But remember that I'm nomadic<br/>
By nature and have learned<br/>
When not to hold my breath.<br/>
Even if you know by heart<br/>
The way home, expect me<br/>
To have progressed from where you left.<br/>
<br/>
My cheeks are wet<br/>
With trails of pride and yearning,<br/>
As I watch you become a fleck<br/>
Against a canvas of blue.<br/>
But if nomads possess one skill,<br/>
It's how to move on.<br/>
<br/>
My eagle, my companion<br/>
I would never hold you back.<br/>
Perhaps you'll find another arm<br/>
On which to perch,<br/>
Or perhaps<br/>
I'll find another bird.<br/>
</p>
