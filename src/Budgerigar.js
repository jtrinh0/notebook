<br/>
I am a Budgerigar<br/>
In the daytime.<br/>
<br/>
Once the sun sets,<br/>
I become a Leucistic Hummingbird,<br/>
White wings blurring<br/>
And syrupy sweet nectar filling my belly.<br/>
<br/>
I become a Peafowl,<br/>
Blue and green eyes<br/>
Folding out behind me<br/>
In a majestic display.<br/>
<br/>
I become a Toucan,<br/>
Dancing in the mist,<br/>
Feet sliding against moss.<br/>
<br/>
I become a Horned Owl,<br/>
Orange eyes piercing into the night<br/>
Waiting for the slightest rustle.<br/>
<br/>
I become a King Vulture,<br/>
Soaring through the wind,<br/>
Swooping down towards the tropical lowland forest,<br/>
Talons empowering me.<br/>
<br/>
Because when I dream,<br/>
I fly.<br/>
<br/>
I awake to the realization that<br/>
A golden cage is still<br/>
Just a cage.
