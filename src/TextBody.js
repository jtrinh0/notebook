    <br/><i>May 26, 2017</i><br/><i>106 line read - $0.73</i><br/><br/>Have you met someone with whom you feel such a strong connection that you wonder if this person could be the love of your life? Here are seven signs you two are right for each other:<br/><br/>
    1. <b>You are complementary.</b><br/>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
          <i>The forces the drive you two are aligned.</i> For example, if one of you aims for freedom while the other seeks safety, then you will most likely not be compatible in the long run. Try summarizing the goal of your existence in a single word and see how it compares with that of your partner.
		  <i> You agree on key topics.</i> It is a good sign if you and your partner are on the same page when it comes to potentially controversial things, such as religious devoutness or politics. Some questions you may consider when determining whether you have similar visions for the future are the city in which you plan to settle down and whether or not you want to have kids and pets.
		  <i> You influence each other to become better.</i> You and your partner should challenge and help each other grow, character-wise, intellectually, etc. You should want to give more and become a better person, because both of you deserve the best version of yourself.
		  <i> You are best friends.</i> This means you are completely comfortable around each other. You aren't embarrassed of being yourself for fear it would make you look bad. You deeply care for and appreciate each other. You understand each other's sense of humor and frequency speak in inside jokes. You don't chastise your partner. Some people are quick to reprimand or yell or throw things at their partner, but they would not behave in this way towards their friends. Treat your partner with as much if not more kindess and compassion than you would your best friend.
          <i> There is physical attraction.</i> Chemistry can't be forced. Of course, you can become more attracted to someone upon greater exposure to their personality, but usually, you can tell early on whether or not you are attracted to someone.
    <br/><br/>
    2. <b>You cultivate a channel of open and honest communication.</b><br/>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
          <i>Both of you take the honest route over the easy route and are alright being vulnerable.</i> Many subjects are difficult to discuss, but you and your partner are always honest with each other. You choose not to tell even the simplest white lie with the understanding that honest communication plays a fundamental role in building trust. You let your partner in, even when you feel the urge to put your gaurd up, because you trust that your partner would be understanding and not negatively judge or criticize you.
          <i> Neither of you hold the past against each other.</i> If your partner shares with you acedotes of his or her experiences prior to meeting you, accept them with grace. Understand that it was in the past and may or may not be a defining factor in who your partner is now, so if you hold it against them, they will be inclined not to share again. Instead, thank them for having the courage to open up so that you can learn more about them. Similarly, when you get into arguments, refrain from using something of the past against them. Be forgiving. It is a position indication in your relaitonship, if the two of you are able to move forward and propel the communcation between you.
          <i> You listen and value the other's opinion.</i> Allot your attention to actively listening to the things your partner says. If you ask them for advice, take their words into consideration and demonstrate how you care about their thoughts and feelings.
          <i> You pick up on each other's emotional language even without words.</i>Your partner can detect when you are down or if there is something on your mind without you telling them in words. It goes both ways that you are not expected to always be able to pick up on the unspoken, you should know them enough and pay attention when something is off.
    <br/><br/>
    3. <b>You have mutual respect.</b><br/>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
          <i>You and your partner value each other's independence.</i> You aren't tied to each other out of need but instead choose to be together because you help enhance the quality of each other's lives. Some people may call their partner their other half, but it is healthier when both of you are complete on your own. You can't expect to each give 50% and expect to be 100% together, but if you are both 100%, you can come together to be greater than the sum of your parts. You can choose to rely on your partner without being needy.
          <i> You are supportive.</i> You refrain from putting each other down, privately or especially publicly. No one wants to be bad-mouthed, especially by the person who is supposed to love them and understand them most. Be someone who makes their partner feel good about themselves. Go to your partner if you want to discuss an issue between the two of you, rather than going around ranting to friends and coworkers about the problems of your relationship.
          <i> You focus on the positive.</i> Anytime your partner does something that bugs you, remember that there are at least fifty qualities you admire in your partner and fifty things he or she does right. Recognize and appreciate your partners efforts before you try to "fix" every little thing you dislike about him or her.
          <i> You earn your partner's trust.</i> You respect them enough not to do something that would hurt them behind their back. You strive to be trustworthy if you expect your partner to do the same.
    <br/><br/>
    4. <b>You are a team.</b><br/>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
          <i>You are each other's go-to.</i> Whether you have exciting or tragic news, your partner is the first person with whom you share it.
          <i> You maintain an "us" versus "issue" mentality.</i> Every argument is followed by a hug.
          <i> You empower each other.</i> This means that rather than always doing something for the other, you help enable your partner to help him or herself. You work <i>with</i> not <i>for</i> each other.
          <i> You are considerate towards the other, even if it creates a bit more work for yourself.</i> You do things to make your partner's life easier without keeping score. For example, you do their laundry to allow them to sleep in when they're tired, or they take care of you when you're sick. You add to each other's strengths.
          <i> You are flexible and willing to improve.</i> There are storms that can uproot pine trees, because even though they are big and seemingly strong, they are rigid and do not have roots deep enough to keep them grounded. You and your partner should aim to be more like bamboos, flexible enough to bend and resillient enough to adapt where necessary. As long as you both retain enough determination to improve, you will be capable of withstanding adversities.
          <i> You have semipermeable membranes.</i> You have confidence in your relationship and are selective of which words of others affect your relationship. You try not to let outside negativity get to you.
    <br/><br/>
    5. <b>You relationship is multifaceted.</b><br/>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
          <i>You have honeymoon cycles.</i> Instead of outliving a honeymoon phase, you two are able to put aside the rainbows when it gets serious but are able to return to the giddy and romantic passion.
          <i> Your relationship is dynamic.</i> You are able to share your hearts and minds and quench each other's intellectual thirst by sharing ideas and philosophizing together. You can talk business or goof around like kids. Your spontaneity and adventurouness makes your relationship thrilling, but you also know how to relax and enjoy a lazy day with each other. Ultimately, you have the ability to adapt to various situations together.
    <br/><br/>
    6. <b>You make an effort to scuba dive.</b><br/>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
          <i>You dare to venture outside of your natural habitats and participate in activities you would not otherwise, simply because it makes the other happy.</i> For example, you find enjoyment in watching NBA games with your partner, even though you aren't as passionate about basketball, since you're aware of how much your partner likes it. Or perhaps your partner accompanies you from time to time when you go shopping, even if the mall isn't his favorite place. You are not only willing to do things with your partner, but you enjoy it because of how much it lights up your partner's face.
          <i> You are open-minded and empathetic.</i> You want to learn more about and share your partner's hobbies. Your healthy amount of differences allow you to learn from each other, expand your perspectives, and try new things you may end up loving.
    <br/><br/>
    7. <b>You continually choose each other.</b><br/>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
          <i>You resist temptations by acknowlegding them.</i> Being in a relationship does not suddenly blind you from the attractiveness of others. Instead of trying to ignore someone else's beauty, you recognize it as a passing thought and then move on. 
          <i> You are patient and have reflective discussions.</i> You are willing to both accept and provide constructive criticism accordingly. You treat your partner gently when your partner has the courage to ask for your help in trying to rectify a particular habit. You maintain composure in stressful situations, and you talk things out instead of holding onto anger or frustration. You are forgiving of each other's mistakes. You're willing to give as many chances as it takes to fight for your love.
          <i> You love each other unconditionally, even when it's difficult.</i> Anyone can relish in fun, but only someone who truly cares will readily sacrifice for you, especially at your lowest points.
          <i> You two think of yourselves as a unit instead of individuals.</i>  When your partner is sad, you find yourself crying with them. When you're hurt, your partner bleeds with you. You are part of each other and thus face problems side by side.
          <i> You work to build a future together.</i> You both put in the effort and make short-term sacrifices in order to create a better long-term for and with each other.
          <i> You prioritize and cherish your love, because you recognize that it is a gift.</i> In a world where you could have anyone you wanted, you would still run home to your partner's open arms.<br/><br/>

          So... have you found a keeper?
